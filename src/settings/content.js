    Find the easiest path! Select a starting block and an ending block.
    To make things more interesting, add some challenges like water and swamp for the pathfinder to avoid.
    You can also make things easier by drawing roads made of dirt and asphalt.
    Once you press find path, the computer will search for the easiest
    path using Dijkstra's algorithm.
